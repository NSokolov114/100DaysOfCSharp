# 100DaysOfCSharp
An adaptaion of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge (see [website](http://100daysofcode.com/) or [group on X](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode)). I already did it a few years ago (the log is [here](https://github.com/NSokolov114/100DaysOfCode)), but that was a different language and a different country.

The goal of this challenge is to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. I will start by completing one big [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-csharp-masterclass) on C#, and then dig into something specific. Patterns?

I can't do it every day, with the full time work and weeks of travelling, but I'll try to do a 100 days in less than 4 months. Let's see.
